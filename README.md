## PROJECT

Servo Motor Control with an Arduino

You can connect small servo motors directly to an Arduino to control the shaft position very precisely.
Because servo motors use feedback to determine the position of the shaft, you can control that position very precisely. As a result, servo motors are used to control the position of objects, rotate objects, move legs, arms or hands of robots, move sensors etc. with high precision. Servo motors are small in size, and because they have built-in circuitry to control their movement, they can be connected directly to an Arduino.  
 
Most servo motors have the following three connections: 

Black/Brown ground wire. 

Red power wire (around 5V). 

Yellow or White PWM wire.

 
## Experiment
In this experiment, we will connect the power and ground pins directly to the Arduino 5V and GND pins. The PWM input will be connected to one of the Arduino's digital output pins.
